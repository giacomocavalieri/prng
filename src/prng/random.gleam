// DEFINITION ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

/// A `Generator(a)` is a data structure that _describes_ how to produce random
/// values of type `a`.
/// 
/// Take for example the following generator for random integers:
/// 
/// ```gleam
/// let dice_roll: Generator(Int) = random.int(1, 6)
/// ```
/// 
/// It is just describing the values that can be generated - in this case the
/// numbers from 1 to 6 - but it is not actually producing any value.
///
/// ## Getting values out of a generator
/// 
/// To actually get a value out of a generator you can use the `step` function:
/// it takes a generator and a `Seed` as input and produces a new seed and a
/// random value of the type described by the generator:
/// 
/// ```gleam
/// import prng/random
/// import prng/seed
///
/// let #(roll_result, updated_seed) = dice_roll |> random.step(seed.new(11))
///
/// roll_result
/// // -> 3
/// ```
/// 
/// The generator is completely deterministic: this means that - given the same
/// seed - it will always produce the same results, no matter how many times you
/// call the `step` function.
/// 
/// `step` will produce an updated seed that you can use for subsequent calls to
/// get different pseudo-random results:
/// 
/// ```gleam
/// let initial_seed = seed.new(11)
/// let #(first_roll, new_seed) = dice_roll |> random.step(initial_seed)
/// let #(second_roll, _) = dice_roll |> random.step(new_seed)
/// 
/// #(first_roll, second_roll)
/// // -> #(3, 2)
/// ```
/// 
pub opaque type Generator(a) {
  Generator(step: fn(Seed) -> #(a, Seed))
}

// GETTING VALUES OUT OF GENERATORS --------------------------------------------

/// Steps a `Generator(a)` producing a random value of type `a` using the given
/// seed as the source of randomness.
/// 
/// The stepping logic is completely deterministic. This means that, given a
/// seed and a generator, you'll always get the same result.
/// 
/// This is why this function also returns a new seed that can be used to make
/// subsequent calls to `step` to get other random values.
/// 
/// Stepping a generator by hand can be quite cumbersome, so I recommend you
/// try [`to_iterator`](#to_iterator),
/// [`to_random_iterator`](#to_random_iterator), or [`sample`](#sample) instead.
/// 
/// ## Examples
/// 
/// ```gleam
/// let initial_seed = seed.new(11)
/// let dice_roll = random.int(1, 6)
/// let #(first_roll, new_seed) = random.step(dice_roll, initial_seed)
/// let #(second_roll, _) = random.step(dice_roll, new_seed)
///
/// #(first_roll, second_roll)
/// // -> #(3, 2)
/// ```
/// 
pub fn step(generator: Generator(a), seed: Seed) -> #(a, Seed) {
  generator.step(seed)
}

/// Generates a single value using the given generator and seed.
/// 
/// This is just a shorthand for the `step` function that drops the new
/// seed. It can be useful if you just need to get a single value out of
/// a generator and need the result to be reproducible.
/// 
pub fn sample(from generator: Generator(a), with seed: Seed) -> a {
  step(generator, seed).0
}

/// Generates a single value using the given generator.
/// 
/// The initial seed is chosen randomly so you won't have control over which
/// value is generated and may get different results each time you call this
/// function.
/// 
/// This is useful if you want to quickly get a value out of a generator and
/// do not care about reproducibility (if you want to decide which seed is
/// used for the generation process you'll have to use `random.step`).
/// 
/// ## Examples
/// 
/// Imagine you want to perform some action, say only 40% of the times.
/// Your code may look like this:
/// 
/// ```gleam
/// let probability = random.float(0.0, 1.0)
/// case random.random_sample(probability) <= 0.4 {
///   True -> perform_action()
///   False -> Nil // do nothing
/// }
/// ```

/// `then` is a really powerful function, almost all functions exposed by this

/// Take as an example `map`, it can be implemented like this:
/// 
/// ```gleam
/// fn map(generator: Generator(a), with fun: fn(a) -> b) -> Generator(b) {
///   random.then(generator, fn(value) {

/// > `use` syntax, especially if it has some deep nesting. As an example, this
/// > is how you can rewrite the previous example taking advantage of `use`:

/// > ```gleam
/// > fn map(generator: Generator(a), with fun: fn(a) -> b) -> Generator(b) {
/// >   use value <- random.then(generator)

/// like this:
/// 
/// ```gleam
/// let bool_generator = random.int(1, 2) |> random.map(fn(n) { n == 1 })
/// ```
/// 
/// Here `map` allows you to transform the values produced by the initial
/// integer generator - either 1 or 2 - into boolean values: when the original
/// generator produces a 1, `bool_generator` will produce `True`; when the

/// 
/// ```gleam
/// pub type Point {
///   Point(x: Float, y: Float)
/// }
/// ```

/// let x_generator = random.float(-1.0, 1.0)
/// let y_generator = random.float(-1.0, 1.0)
/// let point_generator = map2(x_generator, y_generator, Point)
